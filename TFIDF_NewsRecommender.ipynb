       "'WASHINGTON  —   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration’s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. Trump’s administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. “Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,” said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. “Upon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ” In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyer’s decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they “and the  ’s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  ’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. ” The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will “provide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ” Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of “cascading effects” if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ’s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case “will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nation’s health insurance and health care systems generally. ” No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  —   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  —   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  —   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.'"

tour of the talk show chat with jay leno regi philbin and joy behar as he heard from fan all over the world his elat knew no bound but in the year sinc more than 100 pound have crept back onto his frame despit his best effort in fact most of that season s 16 contest have regain much if not all the weight they lost so arduous some are even heavier now yet their experi while a bitter person disappoint have been a gift to scienc a studi of season 8 s contest has yield surpris new discoveri about the physiolog of obes that help explain whi so mani peopl struggl unsuccess to keep off the weight they lose kevin hall a scientist at a feder research center who admit to a weak for realiti tv had the idea to follow the biggest loser contest for six year after that victori night the project was the first to measur what happen to peopl over as long as six year after they had lost larg amount of weight with intens diet and exercis the result the research said were stun they show just how hard the bodi fight back against weight loss it is frighten and amaz said dr hall an expert on metabol at the nation institut of diabet and digest and kidney diseas which is part of the nation institut of health i am just blown away it has to do with rest metabol which determin how mani calori a person burn when at rest when the show began the contest though huge overweight had normal metabol for their size mean they were burn a normal number of calori for peopl of their weight when it end their metabol had slow radic and their bodi were not burn enough calori to maintain their thinner size research knew that just about anyon who deliber lose weight even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight will have a slower metabol when the diet end so they were not surpris to see that the biggest loser contest had slow metabol when the show end what shock the research was what happen next as the year went by and the number on the scale climb the contest metabol did not recov they becam even slower and the pound kept pile on it was as if their bodi were intensifi their effort to pull the contest back to their origin weight mr cahil was one of the worst off as he regain more than 100 pound his metabol slow so much that just to maintain his current weight of 295 pound he now has to eat 800 calori a day less than a typic man his size anyth more turn to fat the struggl the contest went through help explain whi it has been so hard to make headway against the nation s obes problem which afflict more than a third of american adult despit spend billion of dollar on drug and diet program even the most motiv are work against their own biolog their experi show that the bodi will fight back for year and that said dr michael schwartz an obes and diabet research who is a professor of medicin at the univers of washington is new and import the key point is that you can be on tv you can lose enorm amount of weight you can go on for six year but you can t get away from a basic biolog realiti said dr schwartz who was not involv in the studi as long as you are below your initi weight your bodi is go to tri to get you back the show s doctor robert huizenga say he expect the contest metabol rate to fall just after the show but was hope for a smaller drop he question though whether the measur six year later were accur but maintain weight loss is difficult he said which is whi he tell contest that they should exercis at least nine hour a week and monitor their diet to keep the weight off unfortun mani contest are unabl to find or afford adequ ongo support with exercis doctor psychologist sleep specialist and trainer and that s someth we all need to work hard to chang he said in an email the studi s find to be publish on monday in the journal obes are part of a scientif push to answer some of the most fundament question about obes research are figur out whi be fat make so mani peopl develop diabet and other medic condit and they are search for new way to block the poison in fat they are start to unravel the reason bariatr surgeri allow most peopl to lose signific amount of weight when diet so often fail and they are look afresh at medic care for obes peopl the hope is that this work will eventu lead to new therapi that treat obes as a chronic diseas and can help keep weight under control for life most peopl who have tri to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off but mani blame themselv when the pound come back but what obes research has consist shown is that dieter are at the merci of their own bodi which muster hormon and an alter metabol rate to pull them back to their old weight whether that is hundr of pound more or that extra 10 or 15 that mani peopl are tri to keep off there is alway a weight a person s bodi maintain without ani effort and while it is not known whi that weight can chang over the year it may be an effect of age at ani point there is a weight that is easi to maintain and that is the weight the bodi fight to defend find a way to thwart these mechan is the goal scientist are strive for first though they are tri to understand them in greater detail dr david ludwig the director of the new balanc foundat obes prevent center at boston children s hospit who was not involv in the research said the find show the need for new approach to weight control he caution that the studi was limit by it small size and the lack of a control group of obes peopl who did not lose weight but he ad the find made sens this is a subset of the most success dieter he said if they don t show a return to normal in metabol what hope is there for the rest of us still he ad that shouldn t be interpret to mean we are doom to battl our biolog or remain fat it mean we need to explor other approach some scientist say weight mainten has to be treat as an issu separ from weight loss onli when that challeng is solv they say can progress truli be made against obes there is a lot of basic research we still need to do said dr margaret jackson who is direct a project at pfizer her group is test a drug that in anim at least act like leptin a hormon that control hunger with weight loss leptin level fall and peopl becom hungri the idea is to trick the brain of peopl who have lost weight so they do not becom raven for lack of leptin while mani of the contest kept enough weight off to improv their health and becam more physic activ the low weight they strive to keep elud all but one of them erinn egbert a caregiv for her mother in versaill ky and she struggl mightili to keep the pound off becaus her metabol burn 552 fewer calori a day than would be expect for someon her size what peopl don t understand is that a treat is like a drug said ms egbert who went from 263 pound to just under 176 on the show and now weigh between 152 and 157 two treat can turn into a bing over a period that is what i struggl with six year after season 8 end 14 of the 16 contest went to the n i h last fall for three day of test the research were concern that the contest might tri to frantic lose weight befor come in so they ship equip to them that would measur their physic activ and weight befor their visit and had the inform sent remot to the n i h the contest receiv their metabol result last week they were shock but on further reflect decid the number explain a lot all my friend were drink beer and not gain massiv amount of weight mr cahil said the moment i start drink beer there goe anoth 20 pound i said this is not right someth is wrong with my bodi sean algaier 36 a pastor from charlott n c feel cheat he went from 444 pound to 289 as a contest on the show now his weight is up to 450 again and he is burn 458 fewer calori a day than would be expect for a man his size it s kind of like hear you have a life sentenc he said slower metabol were not the onli reason the contest regain weight though they constant battl hunger crave and bing the investig found at least one reason plummet level of leptin the contest start out with normal level of leptin by the season s final they had almost no leptin at all which would have made them raven all the time as their weight return their leptin level drift up again but onli to about half of what they had been when the season began the research found thus help to explain their urg to eat leptin is just one of a cluster of hormon that control hunger and although dr hall and his colleagu did not measur the rest of them anoth group of research in a differ project did in a studi fund by australia s nation health and medic research council dr joseph proietto of the univers of melbourn and his colleagu recruit 50 overweight peopl who agre to consum just 550 calori a day for eight or nine week they lost an averag of near 30 pound but over the next year the pound start come back dr proietto and his colleagu look at leptin and four other hormon that satiat peopl level of most of them fell in their studi subject they also look at a hormon that make peopl want to eat it level rose what was surpris was what a coordin effect it is dr proietto said the bodi put multipl mechan in place to get you back to your weight the onli way to maintain weight loss is to be hungri all the time we desper need agent that will suppress hunger and that are safe with use mr cahil 46 said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade he got fat then fatter he would starv himself and then eat a whole can of cake frost with a spoon afterward he would cower in the pantri off the kitchen feel overwhelm with shame over the

he was too heavi to sleep lie down walk hurt stair were agoni buy cloth with a 68 waist was humili i rememb sit in a dress room one day and noth would fit i look at the traffic outsid on the street and thought i should just run out in front of a car he eventu seiz on the biggest loser as his best chanc to lose enough weight to live a normal life he tri three time and was final select befor the show began the contest underw medic test to be sure they could endur the rigor schedul that lay ahead and rigor it was sequest on the biggest loser ranch with the other contest mr cahil exercis seven hour a day burn 8 000 to 9 000 calori accord to a calori tracker the show gave him he took electrolyt tablet to help replac the salt he lost through sweat consum mani fewer calori than befor eventu he and the other were sent home for four month to tri to keep lose weight on their own mr cahil set a goal of a deficit per day the idea was to lose a pound a day he quit his job as a land surveyor to do it his routin went like this wake up at 5 a m and run on a treadmil for 45 minut have breakfast typic one egg and two egg white half a grapefruit and a piec of sprout grain toast run on the treadmil for anoth 45 minut rest for 40 minut bike ride nine mile to a gym work out for two and a half hour shower ride home eat lunch typic a grill skinless chicken breast a cup of broccoli and 10 spear of asparagus rest for an hour drive to the gym for anoth round of exercis if he had not burn enough calori to hit his goal he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more at time he found himself run around his neighborhood in the dark until his indic reset to zero at midnight on the day of the on the show s final mr cahil and the other dress care to hide the roll of loos skin that remain to their surpris and horror after they had lost weight they wore compress undergar to hold it in mr cahil knew he could not maintain his final weight of 191 pound he was so mental and physic exhaust he bare move for two week after his public tour end but he had start a new career give motiv speech as the biggest loser ever and for the next four year he manag to keep his weight below 255 pound by exercis two to three hour a day but two year ago he went back to his job as a surveyor and the pound start come back soon the scale hit 265 mr cahil start weigh and measur his food again and step up his exercis he got back down to 235 to 240 pound but his weight edg up again to 275 then 295 his slow metabol is part of the problem and so are his food crave he open a bag of chip think he will have just a few i d eat five bite then i d black out and eat the whole bag of chip and say what did i do dr lee kaplan an obes research at harvard say the brain set the number of calori we consum and it can be easi for peopl to miss that how much they eat matter less than the fact that their bodi want to hold on to more of those calori dr michael rosenbaum an obes research at columbia univers who has collabor with dr hall in previous studi said the bodi s system for regul how mani calori are consum and how mani are burn are tight coupl when peopl are not strenuous tri to lose weight or to

part of the nation institut of health i am just blown away it has to do with rest metabol which determin how mani calori a person burn when at rest when the show began the contest though huge overweight had normal metabol for their size mean they were burn a normal number of calori for peopl of their weight when it end their metabol had slow radic and their bodi were not burn enough calori to maintain their thinner size research knew that just about anyon who deliber lose weight even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight will have a slower metabol when the diet end so they were not surpris to see that the biggest loser contest had slow metabol when the show end what shock the research was what happen next as the year went by and the number on the scale climb the contest metabol did not recov they becam even slower and the pound kept pile on it was as if their bodi were intensifi their effort to pull the contest back to their origin weight mr cahil was one of the worst off as he regain more than 100 pound his metabol slow so much that just to maintain his current weight of 295 pound he now has to eat 800 calori a day less than a typic man his size anyth more turn to fat the struggl the contest went through help explain whi it has been so hard to make headway against the nation s obes problem which afflict more than a third of american adult despit spend billion of dollar on drug and diet program even the most motiv are work against their own biolog their experi show that the bodi will fight back for year and that said dr michael schwartz an obes and diabet research who is a professor of medicin at the univers of washington is new and import the key point is that you can be on tv you can lose enorm amount of weight you can go on for six year but you can t get away from a basic biolog realiti said dr schwartz who was not involv in the studi as long as you are below your initi weight your bodi is go to tri to get you back the show s doctor robert huizenga say he expect the contest metabol rate to fall just after the show but was hope for a smaller drop he question though whether the measur six year later were accur but maintain weight loss is difficult he said which is whi he tell contest that they should exercis at least nine hour a week and monitor their diet to keep the weight off unfortun mani contest are unabl to find or afford adequ ongo support with exercis doctor psychologist sleep specialist and trainer and that s someth we all need to work hard to chang he said in an email the studi s find to be publish on monday in the journal obes are part of a scientif push to answer some of the most fundament question about obes research are figur out whi be fat make so mani peopl develop diabet and other medic condit and they are search for new way to block the poison in fat they are start to unravel the reason bariatr surgeri allow most peopl to lose signific amount of weight when diet so often fail and they are look afresh at medic care for obes peopl the hope is that this work will eventu lead to new therapi that treat obes as a chronic diseas and can help keep weight under control for life most peopl who have tri to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off but mani blame themselv when the pound come back but what obes research has consist shown is that dieter are at the merci of their own bodi which muster hormon and an alter metabol rate to pull them back to their old weight whether that is hundr of pound more or that extra 10 or 15 that mani peopl are tri to keep off there is alway a weight a person s bodi maintain without ani effort and while it is not known whi that weight can chang over the year it may be an effect of age at ani point there is a weight that is easi to maintain and that is the weight the bodi fight to defend find a way to thwart these mechan is the goal scientist are strive for first though they are tri to understand them in greater detail dr david ludwig the director of the new balanc foundat obes prevent center at boston children s hospit who was not involv in the research said the find show the need for new approach to weight control he caution that the studi was limit by it small size and the lack of a control group of obes peopl who did not lose weight but he ad the find made sens this is a subset of the most success dieter he said if they don t show a return to normal in metabol what hope is there for the rest of us still he ad that shouldn t be interpret to mean we are doom to battl our biolog or remain fat it mean we need to explor other approach some scientist say weight mainten has to be treat as an issu separ from weight loss onli when that challeng is solv they say can progress truli be made against obes there is a lot of basic research we still need to do said dr margaret jackson who is direct a project at pfizer her group is test a drug that in anim at least act like leptin a hormon that control hunger with weight loss leptin level fall and peopl becom hungri the idea is to trick the brain of peopl who have lost weight so they do not becom raven for lack of leptin while mani of the contest kept enough weight off to improv their health and becam more physic activ the low weight they strive to keep elud all but one of them erinn egbert a caregiv for her mother in versaill ky and she struggl mightili to keep the pound off becaus her metabol burn 552 fewer calori a day than would be expect for someon her size what peopl don t understand is that a treat is like a drug said ms egbert who went from 263 pound to just under 176 on the show and now weigh between 152 and 157 two treat can turn into a bing over a period that is what i struggl with six year after season 8 end 14 of the 16 contest went to the n i h last fall for three day of test the research were concern that the contest might tri to frantic lose weight befor come in so they ship equip to them that would measur their physic activ and weight befor their visit and had the inform sent remot to the n i h the contest receiv their metabol result last week they were shock but on further reflect decid the number explain a lot all my friend were drink beer and not gain massiv amount of weight mr cahil said the moment i start drink beer there goe anoth 20 pound i said this is not right someth is wrong with my bodi sean algaier 36 a pastor from charlott n c feel cheat he went from 444 pound to 289 as a contest on the show now his weight is up to 450 again and he is burn 458 fewer calori a day than would be expect for a man his size it s kind of like hear you have a life sentenc he said slower metabol were not the onli reason the contest regain weight though they constant battl hunger crave and bing the investig found at least one reason plummet level of leptin the contest start out with normal level of leptin by the season s final they had almost no leptin at all which would have made them raven all the time as their weight return their leptin level drift up again but onli to about half of what they had been when the season began the research found thus help to explain their urg to eat leptin is just one of a cluster of hormon that control hunger and although dr hall and his colleagu did not measur the rest of them anoth group of research in a differ project did in a studi fund by australia s nation health and medic research council dr joseph proietto of the univers of melbourn and his colleagu recruit 50 overweight peopl who agre to consum just 550 calori a day for eight or nine week they lost an averag of near 30 pound but over the next year the pound start come back dr proietto and his colleagu look at leptin and four other hormon that satiat peopl level of most of them fell in their studi subject they also look at a hormon that make peopl want to eat it level rose what was surpris was what a coordin effect it is dr proietto said the bodi put multipl mechan in place to get you back to your weight the onli way to maintain weight loss is to be hungri all the time we desper need agent that will suppress hunger and that are safe with use mr cahil 46 said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade he got fat then fatter he would starv himself and then eat a whole can of cake frost with a spoon afterward he would cower in the pantri off the kitchen feel overwhelm with shame over the year his insati urg to eat kept overcom him and his weight climb 370 pound 400 460 485 i use to look at myself and think i am horribl i am a monster subhuman he said he began sleep in a reclin becaus he was too heavi to sleep lie down walk hurt stair were agoni buy cloth with a 68 waist was humili i rememb sit in a dress room one day and noth would fit i look at the traffic outsid on the street and thought i should just run out in front of a car he eventu seiz on the biggest loser as his best chanc to lose enough weight to live a normal life he tri three time and was final select befor the show began the contest underw medic test to be sure they could endur the rigor schedul that lay ahead and rigor it was sequest on the biggest loser ranch with the other contest mr cahil exercis seven hour a day burn 8 000 to 9 000 calori accord to a calori tracker the show gave him he took electrolyt tablet to help replac the salt he lost through sweat consum mani fewer calori than befor eventu he and the other were sent home for four month to tri to keep lose weight on their own mr cahil set a goal of a deficit per day the idea was to lose a pound a day he quit his job as a land surveyor to do it his routin went like this wake up at 5 a m and run on a treadmil for 45 minut have breakfast typic one egg and two egg white half a grapefruit and a piec of sprout grain toast run on the treadmil for anoth 45 minut rest for 40 minut bike ride nine mile to a gym work out for two and a half hour shower ride home eat lunch typic a grill skinless chicken breast a cup of broccoli and 10 spear of asparagus rest for an hour drive to the gym for anoth round of exercis if he had not burn enough calori to hit his goal he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more at time he found himself run around his neighborhood in the dark until his indic reset to zero at midnight on the day of the on the show s final mr cahil and the other dress care to hide the roll of loos skin that remain to their surpris and horror after they had lost weight they wore compress undergar to hold it in mr cahil knew he could not maintain his final weight of 191 pound he was so mental and physic exhaust he bare move for two week after his public tour end but he had start a new career give motiv speech as the biggest loser ever and for the next four year he manag to keep his weight below 255 pound by exercis two to three hour a day but two year ago he went back to his job as a surveyor and the pound start come back soon the scale hit 265 mr cahil start weigh and measur his food again and step up his exercis he got back down to 235 to 240 pound but his weight edg up again to 275 then 295 his slow metabol is part of the problem and so are his food crave he open a bag of chip think he will have just a few i d eat five bite then i d black out and eat the whole bag of chip and say what did i do dr lee kaplan an obes research at harvard say the brain set the number of calori we consum and it can be easi for peopl to miss that how much they eat matter less than the fact that their bodi want to hold on to more of those calori dr michael rosenbaum an obes research at columbia univers who has collabor with dr hall in previous studi said the bodi s system for regul how mani calori are consum and how mani are burn are tight coupl when peopl are not strenuous tri to lose weight or to maintain a signific weight loss still pound can insidi creep on we eat about 900 000 to a million calori a year and burn them all except those annoy 3 000 to 5 000 calori that result in an averag annual weight gain of about one to two pound he said these veri small differ between intak and output averag out to onli about 10 to 20 calori per day less than one starburst candi but the cumul consequ over time can be devast it is not clear whether this small imbal and the result weight gain that most of us experi as we age are the consequ of chang in lifestyl the environ or just the biolog of age dr rosenbaum ad the effect of small imbal between calori eaten and calori burn are more pronounc when peopl deliber lose weight dr hall said yes there are signal to regain weight but he wonder how mani extra calori peopl were driven to eat he found a way to figur that out he analyz data from a clinic trial in which peopl took a diabet drug canagliflozin that make them spill 360 calori a day into their urin or took a placebo the drug has no known effect on the brain and the person doe not realiz those calori are be spill those take the drug gradual lost weight but for everi five pound they lost they were without realiz it eat an addit 200 calori a day those extra calori dr hall said were a bigger driver of weight regain than the slow of the metabol and he ad if peopl fought the urg to eat those calori they would be hungri unless they continu to fight it constant they will regain the weight he said all this doe not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless expert say individu respond differ to diet manipul or diet for exampl and to exercis and drug among other intervent but dr ludwig said that simpli cut calori was not the answer there are no doubt except individu who can ignor primal biolog signal and maintain weight loss for the long term by restrict calori he said but he ad that for most peopl the combin of incess hunger and slow metabol is a recip for weight regain explain whi so few individu can maintain weight loss for more than a few month dr rosenbaum agre the difficulti in keep weight off reflect biolog not a patholog lack of willpow affect of the u s a he said mr cahil know that now and with his report from dr hall s group show just how much his metabol had slow he stop blame himself for his weight gain that shame that was on my shoulder went off he said just how is hillari kerr the founder of a digit media compani in los angel she can tell you what song was play five year ago on the jukebox at

circul in india which came into full effect at midnight friday the last day for deposit the old note at bank set off cash shortag that have hit the countri s most vulner peopl hard and prompt worri about the economi but despit those concern as well as doubt about whether the currenc ban will reduc corrupt as it is design to do for the moment at least mr modi s bet appear to be pay off in the public arena even as the poorest indian have struggl mani have continu to voic support for the prime minist s initi to target the vast amount of untax money known as black money flow through the countri s economi in hope that it will combat an endem cultur of corrupt mr modi analyst say has success tap into deep frustrat with the corrupt that pervad almost everi public interfac with govern even though the cash ban has produc enorm hardship for me and my famili i support what mr modi is do for our countri said hem raj chechi 39 a taxi driver in new delhi the capit who said busi had been down 50 percent sinc the ban was announc mr chechi has not been abl to pay his children s school fee or send money back to his villag to support them for near two month but he said we need to fight black money even though it is hurt littl peopl like me mr modi came to power as a disrupt forc pledg to overturn the status quo in new delhi bring job and fight corrupt indian have repeat taken to the street in recent year to demand an end to corrupt wide seen as be most detriment to the poor and powerless declar war on corrupt mr modi announc on nov 8 that 500 and 1 000 rupe bill worth about 8 and 15 would be ban the next morn with the currenc ban mr modi has manag to convinc mani disaffect indian that he is on their side he has also use his power skill as a communic to persuad peopl like mr chechi that the pain stem from the ban is for the good that frustrat with a polit and busi elit view by mani as corrupt is what drove mani american to vote for donald j trump last year said eswar s prasad an econom professor at cornel univers who is a nativ of india trump made the case that onli he could effect chang by blow up the system mr prasad said in an interview modi in the same way did have a persuas narrat that small chang at the margin can t tackl problem like corrupt we need big and pain chang realli disrupt one mr modi appear on televis on new year s eve to tell indian he understood their pain and urg them to bear with him in the aim of creat a better nation he compar his cash ban to the freedom struggl led by mohanda k gandhi a battl of good versus evil today mahatma gandhi is not among us but the path that was truth that he show us is still most appropri mr modi said use the honorif for gandhi as we begin the centenari year of the satyagraha he said refer to gandhi s nonviol resist movement let us recal the mahatma and resolv to follow his messag of truth and good mr modi was presid over one of the major economi in the world when he announc the ban on the rupe note which made up 86 percent of the money in circul it s a littl bit crazi said geng xiao a professor of financ and public polici at the univers of hong kong when i first read the news i couldn t even figur out if it was true the govern said that peopl deposit larg amount of old currenc more than 250 000 rupe or about 3 670 could be ask to prove that they had paid tax on it some saw vast amount of untax hold sudden render worthless whether mr modi s move will actual reduc corrupt is a matter of debat some economist believ it could pave the way for other measur intend to discourag briberi or restructur the economi but other say the currenc ban is unlik to result in a signific reduct in corrupt even as it has inconvenienc hundr of million of peopl who have struggl to get enough cash to meet their daili need while the govern tri to print enough new note to replac the ban one and a countri short of cash has been unabl to spend it which is like to reduc econom growth in the short term economist say peopl live on the edg of poverti have been hit hard their diet and livelihood sever affect mani in india see mr modi who has also had success persuad parliament to clear the way for a unifi tax to make it easier to ship and sell thing across state line as live up to his promis to be a reform of india s ossifi and bureaucrat economi but in the process he has place the indian economi and his polit futur at risk mani economist believ that the indian economi will take at least a hit becaus of a dire shortag of cash and that the futur impact is uncertain if the effect are prolong the public support for modi could wane if this move damag the economi he s in for a rough ride said harsh pant the head of strateg studi at the observ research foundat a new delhi think
